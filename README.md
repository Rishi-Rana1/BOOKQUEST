# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product Vision Statement

This project aims to assist professors in automating repetitive tasks such as answering common questions, grading quizzes, sending grades, and creating slides efficiently. It leverages a project board to track progress and ensure smooth development.

## User Stories

### Todo
- As a professor, I want to build a Discord or Slack bot to answer common robotic questions so I don't have to copy/paste my previous answers each time.

### In Progress
- As a professor, I want to see project boards so I know how each team is doing.
- As a professor, I want to show how to use project boards so students have the knowledge they need to do the work they do.

### Done
- As a professor, I want to switch to Discord because it has a better FREE plan than Slack.
- As a professor, I want to grade quizzes automatically so the grader and I don't have to spend hours doing repetitive work.
- As a professor, I want to be able to automatically send students their grades so I don't have to do it manually many times.
- As a professor, I would like to automatically create slides from Markdown so I can create slides quickly using just a text editor.
